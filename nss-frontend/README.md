# Frameworks to be used

Although not rigidly fixed, the frameworks we would be using are:

- React
- React Router
- Materialize CSS
- Axios (for backend AJAX calls)

# Routes

[This is a WIP section. Will be updated time to time.]

- Homepage
- News and Notifications
- Admin View (for Professors)
- User View (for creating writeups)
- Report Submission
- Blog Writeups
- User Registration


# [IMPORTANT]

Don't put any sensitive data in the frontend. You may use `Redux` if the complexity of the project increases. Fetch all data from backend using `Axios`.
